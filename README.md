# Big-Data
This repository will store the projects developed in the curricular unit Big Data of my Bioinformatics bachelor's degree.


# 1st Project (Morbility and Mortality)
This project had the main goal to introduce us to the Mongodb tool.
It was a fun but hard challenge that I think will be usefull in a near future
